# Home Assistant on Docker and Kubernetes (Open Source Home Automation)

Are you ready to start automating your smart home with the power of open source?  Do you already have Home Assistant running but need a little more power than a Raspberry Pi?  If so, join me in this easy to follow, step by step tutorial on installing Home Assistant on Docker, Kubernetes, and Rancher. We'll set it up, walk through and configure the UI, and then move on to configure some Wemo smart switches, Phillips Hue bulbs, Google Home / Chromecast devices, and even create a Dark Mode / Light mode automation script using Phillips Hue Scenes!
